# Sign-Up-Page

Project Description:

I am creating a mock up sign up page for my future application Budget Buddy as
a part of the Odin Projects intermediate HTML and CSS course.  The purpose of this
lesson is to learn html forms and their related attributes, as well as practice
other intermediate html and css topics such as positioning, display sizes, and 
emmet shortcuts.
